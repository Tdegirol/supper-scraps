  ## Description
  This app allows users to log in and search ingredients that they have on hand (or would like to cook with). Then the app returns several recipes that include those ingredients with the option to save each recipe to the user's dashboard. This also offers an inspirations page which will offer some random recipes to try out!
  
This application was built using the MERN stack, including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and GraphQL as backend technologies, ApolloServer, and React as well as Javascript, React-Bootstrap framework and Css for front-end technologies.  The Tasty API was utilized for recipes.
